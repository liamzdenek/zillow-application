## Current Blockers

No blockers at this time. The project is in the initial planning and setup phase.

## Recent Achievements

- Defined comprehensive metrics for monitoring real estate professional health
- Designed a segmentation strategy that allows for detailed analysis
- Created a system architecture that balances implementation simplicity with functionality
- Established a technical approach that can be implemented within the one-day timeline

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Complete Memory Bank documentation
2. Initialize NX monorepo structure with required packages
3. Set up .gitignore file
4. Install required dependencies
5. Begin implementing CDK infrastructure
