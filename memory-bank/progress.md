2. Create data generator script to populate DynamoDB with realistic sample data
3. Implement Express.js backend with metrics and simulation endpoints
4. Develop React frontend with Chart.js visualizations
5. Connect frontend to backend API

## Timeline and Milestones

For this one-day project, we've established the following milestones:

1. **Planning and Setup** (1 hour)
   - Define requirements
   - Design architecture
   - Set up project structure

2. **Infrastructure and Data** (2 hours)
   - Implement CDK stack
   - Create data model
   - Generate and load sample data

3. **Backend Implementation** (2 hours)
   - Create API endpoints
   - Implement data retrieval and aggregation
   - Implement simulation logic

4. **Frontend Implementation** (3 hours)
   - Create dashboard UI
   - Implement visualizations
   - Build simulation page
   - Connect to backend

5. **Testing and Refinement** (1 hour)
   - Test end-to-end functionality
   - Refine UI and visualizations
   - Fix any issues

6. **Documentation and Presentation** (1 hour)
   - Update documentation
   - Prepare presentation for Zillow executives

## Known Issues

1. **Package Dependencies**: There are some moderate and high severity vulnerabilities reported by npm audit. These are related to dependencies and don't affect the functionality of our application directly. We can address these in a future update if needed.

2. **Development Timeline**: The one-day timeline remains challenging, but with the project structure now in place and shared types defined, we have a clear path forward for implementation.

## Future Enhancements (Post One-Day Project)

1. **Enhanced Data Model**
   - Move beyond the simplified 500-agent model
   - Implement more sophisticated querying and pagination

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Add trend analysis over time
   - Implement more sophisticated predictive models
   - Add anomaly detection

3. **Configurable Rules**
   - Create UI for configuring simulation rules
   - Allow saving and comparing different rule sets

4. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add audit logging

5. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Add more interactive visualizations
   - Implement drill-down capabilities
   - Add export functionality
