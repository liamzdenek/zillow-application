# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Frontend Development
- Implemented the Dashboard page with metrics and filtering
- Implemented the Simulation page for what-if analysis
- Added TanStack Router for navigation between pages
- Created a custom favicon.svg for the application
- Fixed build configuration to output to the correct location

### Backend Development
- Implemented API endpoints for fetching agent data
- Added filtering capabilities by segment
- Implemented simulation endpoint for what-if analysis
- Fixed dependency installation for Lambda deployment

### Infrastructure
- Created CDK stack for deploying the application
- Set up DynamoDB table with GSIs for each segment type
- Configured Lambda function for the backend API
- Set up API Gateway with CORS support
- Created S3 bucket for hosting the frontend
- Configured CloudFront distribution for secure access
- Implemented path-based routing for API requests
- Updated build process to include dependencies for Lambda

## Deployment Status
- Successfully deployed the CDK stack to AWS
- Frontend is accessible at: https://d1lm2ezci363i3.cloudfront.net
- API is accessible at: https://fdf213jq7b.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/api/
- DynamoDB table name: ZillowDashboardStack-ZillowAgents5D2BFE9D-14YRSJUD4FKTE
- Verified API endpoints are working correctly
- Populated DynamoDB table with 500 sample agent records
- Increased Lambda function timeout to 30 seconds and memory to 1024 MB

## Next Steps
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Implement user authentication if required
- Add more detailed metrics and visualizations
- Add automated tests for the frontend and backend
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Implement monitoring and alerting for the application

## Lessons Learned
- The backend Lambda function requires dependencies to be installed in the dist/packages/backend directory
- The API endpoints are prefixed with /api in the backend code
- The frontend and backend build processes need to be configured to output to the correct locations
- The CDK stack needs to be updated to use the correct paths for the frontend and backend
- The TanStack Router API has changed in version 1.114.15, requiring updates to the imports
