# Product Context: Zillow Real Estate Professional Health Dashboard

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Zillow's 10-K identifies a significant business risk: "Our business could be harmed if real estate professionals reduce or end their spending with us or if we are unable to effectively manage advertising and product inventory or pricing." This risk directly impacts Zillow's revenue stream and business model, as real estate professionals are a key customer segment that contributes significantly to the company's revenue through advertising and premium services.

Currently, Zillow lacks a comprehensive, executive-level view of the health of these relationships, making it difficult to:
1. Identify early warning signs of potential churn
2. Understand which segments of real estate professionals are most at risk
3. Test and implement targeted interventions to improve retention and spending
4. Measure the effectiveness of these interventions

### Solution Value Proposition
The Real Estate Professional Health Dashboard addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Comprehensive Health Monitoring**: A single view of key metrics that indicate the health of relationships with real estate professionals across different segments.

2. **Early Warning System**: Proactive identification of at-risk professionals before they reduce spending or leave the platform.

3. **Segmentation Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of metrics by professional segments to identify patterns and target interventions effectively.

4. **Intervention Simulation**: The ability to model the potential impact of different interventions on specific segments, enabling data-driven decision making.

5. **Executive Decision Support**: Clear, actionable insights that help executives allocate resources effectively to mitigate the identified business risk.

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users: Zillow Executives
The dashboard is designed primarily for Zillow executives who need to:
- Monitor the overall health of relationships with real estate professionals
- Identify concerning trends or segments that require attention
- Make strategic decisions about interventions and resource allocation
- Track the effectiveness of implemented strategies over time

### Key User Journeys

#### Monitoring Overall Health
Executives should be able to quickly assess the overall health of relationships with real estate professionals, with clear indicators of positive and negative trends. The dashboard should highlight the most critical metrics and provide context for interpreting them.

#### Segment Analysis
Users should be able to easily filter the dashboard by different segments to understand how metrics vary across different types of real estate professionals. This helps identify which segments are performing well and which may need targeted attention.

#### Risk Identification
The dashboard should clearly highlight segments or individual professionals who are at high risk of reducing spending or leaving the platform, based on early warning indicators like engagement decline, satisfaction trends, and price sensitivity.

#### Intervention Planning
Users should be able to simulate the potential impact of different interventions on specific segments, helping them make data-driven decisions about where to allocate resources for maximum impact.

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity Over Complexity**: Focus on presenting clear, actionable insights rather than overwhelming users with excessive data.

2. **Context-Rich Metrics**: Ensure metrics are presented with appropriate context (historical trends, benchmarks, targets) to facilitate interpretation.

3. **Action-Oriented**: Design the dashboard to not just present data, but to guide users toward appropriate actions based on the insights.

4. **Segment-Centric**: Make segmentation a core part of the experience, recognizing that different types of real estate professionals have different needs and behaviors.

5. **Forward-Looking**: Emphasize predictive metrics and simulations that help users anticipate and prevent problems, rather than just reacting to them.
